        <p>"رسائل من عمان" means "Letters/Messages from Amman" in Arabic and is pronounced rather like, "rasaa'il min 'ammaan." Amman, Jordan is where I am studying!</p>

        <p>You might have noticed that some content on this site is right-aligned, like the navigation bar. Arabic, the language I am learning, is written from right to left and their web content is flipped like the language. I have built this site in a way that facilitates Arabic reading.</p>

        <p>I hope to post nearly every day for my own records and Arabic practice. Posts may be in Arabic, English or some combination. If you see that I am posting a lot in Arabic and you can't read what I have written, don't hesitate to translate it with Google :)</p>
