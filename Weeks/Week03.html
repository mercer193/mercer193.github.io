          This weekend was awesome. When I was in the U.S. and dreaming about coming to Jordan, I watched video after video on Petra; seeing the treasury in person was incredible. The best part was being there in such a unique circumstance as an extra in an Arabic-language TV series.
</p>
<p>
There were about 25 extras, all in our twenties, but from many places. My roommate was from Switzerland and I spent most of the shooting time with a pharmacy student from Spain. Hilariously, he also enjoys playing PokemonGo.
</p>
<p>
While waiting on the bus that would take us back to Amman yesterday, the Spanish guy and I took a “Pokémon walk” to pass the time and saw a surprise— water, lots of water, simply flowing by the sidewalk. We were shocked as Jordan is one of the five most water scarce countries in the world.
</p>
<p>
Following the water, we came to small rectangular pool next to a one-story, boxy building with three domes. Two men were exiting as we approached and, seeing our curiosity, one stopped to explain that the building houses natural spring water. He ushered us in side and offered a cup for us to drink the water with.
</p>
<p>
Though the experience was not without its drawbacks, I am thankful I decided to sign up as I left with some great new, diverse friends with whom I can enjoy the rest of my time in Amman with.
