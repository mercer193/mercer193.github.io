         اليوم كانت مرتي الأولى في معهد سجال وهو جميلة جداً والأساتذة جيدون أيضاً. الطلاب الآخرين من بلاد بريبريطانيا واستراليا وكندا وألمانيا والسويد والنمسا ولكن معظم الطلاب في مدرستي هم امريكيون. ثلاثة طلاب فقط (معي) يعشون مع عائلات أردنية— لا أعرف لماذا هذا الرقم صغير جدًا... غدا اليوم الأول من الفصل!ء

        <p>It’s a busy week in Amman with both the Arab film festival and the Hakaya story-telling festival taking place. I went to a lecture by an Irish storyteller tonight.
</p>
          <p>
A great deal of his lecture centered around the collection of folklore in the 1930s by school children everywhere in Ireland (with the exception of the north). The students were free from homework for the year (my inner child screamed) but they had to collect folktales, wisdom, superstitions, riddles, songs, and others from their older relatives and neighbors. The effort was enormously successful and Ireland is now in the process of digitalizing the students’ copy books.
</p>
          <p>
In connection to our physical place in the world, the storyteller proposed that the system that was launched in Ireland be repeated in Palestine to preserve Palestinian culture.

        <p>I went to my first Arab wedding today! My host mom asked me if I would like to come with her and her daughters a few days ago and my answer was immediately yes!
</p>
<p>
The most obvious difference between weddings I’ve been to in the U.S. and the wedding in Jordan was that each gender enjoyed the wedding on a separate floor. This allowed the women to take off their hijabs if they wanted to and to bare more skin, but as a result, photography was not allowed.
</p>
<p>
My family did not know the bride and groom very well, so we did not participate in the dancing, but were able to watch the procession of the couple into the room, the ceremonial gifts they received, and, familiarly, the cutting of the cake. A strange feature was that the huge wedding cake the couple “cut” was fake. The real cake only made an appearance as slices handed out after the plastic cake was rolled away.</p>
