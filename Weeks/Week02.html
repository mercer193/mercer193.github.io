         اليوم كانت مرتي الأولى في معهد سجال وهو جميلة جداً والأساتذة جيدون أيضاً. الطلاب الآخرين من بلاد بريبريطانيا واستراليا وكندا وألمانيا والسويد والنمسا ولكن معظم الطلاب في مدرستي هم امريكيون. ثلاثة طلاب فقط (معي) يعشون مع عائلات أردنية— لا أعرف لماذا هذا الرقم صغير جدًا... غدا اليوم الأول من الفصل!ء

        <p>I officially began class today! After an impromptu Arabic lesson from my Uber driver, I had MSA at 9am and dialect in the afternoon. Both classes had only three students including me, so I’m looking forward to the personalized attention from my instructors.

The entirety of the institute is around 40 students by my estimate, but I have been impressed by the quality despite its small size. Some of my cohort have studied at Qasid, a renowned Arabic language institution in Jordan, prior to Sijal and they think our school has an amazing family atmosphere and possibly the best Ammiya dialect education anywhere. I’m grateful to be studying at such a great place!</p>

        <p>An unexpected joy here is the call to prayer (adhan). A few days ago, I was sitting on the bed in my hot room with my 8 year old host sister when it started. She had her head in my lap, playing a game on my phone and I was reclining with my eyes closed. The fan was whirring when the sound resonated through open window; it was so serene. I thought it might be strange to like the sound so much as a non-Muslim, but the subject came up yesterday between other students and they enjoy it too. Music is in every part of the city five times a day— it’s beautiful.

A surprise for me has been that gas peddlers in Amman play music to attract customers like ice cream trucks in the US. Pretty cool, but I prefer chasing after ice cream!</p>

        <p>A good day. The highlight may have been my first time trying fuul (simplistically defined as hummus with beans instead of chickpeas).</p>
