        I had an interview at the Collateral Repair Project this afternoon for volunteer work as an English teacher; it went really well. Starting this Saturday, I will be co-teaching an advanced English course to refugees!

        My friend Anas carpools with me to frisbee— today we left early so he could check out a scholarship fair for overseas education at the W hotel. Unfortunately the trip was unsuccessful as the fair was extremely crowded, but it was a great opportunity to see the swank interior of a foreign W! The most notable feature was a canyon-passage lit all in red, leading from the entrance to the elevators.
