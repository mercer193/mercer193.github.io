        After frisbee, I went to a pizza place with a good portion of the team for brunch which was fun! I had no idea what was in the mini savory pastries and calzones at the counter, but I pointed to two and ended up enjoying a spinach and cheese turnovers.

My eldest host-sister’s friend is moving a couple hours away, so tonight she and her dad went out to visit the family before they leave. When they came back, they had two types of Palestinian kunafa with them! Everyone raves about kunafa, and I can see why.
</p>
<p>
Kunafa is mostly soft cheese with a crust on top, doused in simple syrup and sprinkled with pistachios. There are differences between the dessert regionally, and Palestinian kunafa itself comes in two varieties: soft and crunchy. Luckily for me, the family bought both! Now I know that while both are delectable, I prefer soft kunafa.
