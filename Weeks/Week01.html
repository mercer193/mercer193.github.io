        <p>It’s been about thirty-six hours since I landed in Jordan and the time has passed more quickly and wonderfully than I could have imagined. I was most worried that I would be unable to to communicate with my host family, but they speak English quite well; the eight year old learned from YouTube videos!
          </p>
          <p>
The family speaks to me mostly in English now, but we plan to transition to more and more Arabic once I begin school on Sunday. They are so eager to teach me and we have already spent hours of pointing at things and repeating their names. I think I’ll be able to learn a semester’s worth of material in one month at this rate! So far, so good.</p>

        <p>My Arabic vocabulary has begun to reflect the company I keep: slap, disgusting, and a couple variations on “shut up!” Kids are great, right?
          </p>
          <p>
Mealtimes differ between my Jordanian and American families. So far, I have had a small breakfast at around 9 and a big “linner” at about 4, followed by juice. Later in the evening, family members who are hungry eat leftovers at their leisure. Today’s lunch was best meal yet... a Turkish stew with a kind of soft, flattened meatball, eggplant, and potato. The most unusual food so far has been a sphere of solid yogurt in olive oil (labneh) and rolled in red pepper flakes. Delicious!</p>

        <p>I officially began class today! After an impromptu Arabic lesson from my Uber driver, I had MSA at 9am and dialect in the afternoon. Both classes had only three students including me, so I’m looking forward to the personalized attention from my instructors.
          </p>
          <p>
The entirety of the institute is around 40 students by my estimate, but I have been impressed by the quality despite its small size. Some of my cohort have studied at Qasid, a renowned Arabic language institution in Jordan, prior to Sijal and they think our school has an amazing family atmosphere and possibly the best Ammiya dialect education anywhere. I’m grateful to be studying at such a great place!</p>

        <p>An unexpected joy here is the call to prayer (adhan). A few days ago, I was sitting on the bed in my hot room with my 8 year old host sister when it started. She had her head in my lap, playing a game on my phone and I was reclining with my eyes closed. The fan was whirring when the sound resonated through open window; it was so serene. I thought it might be strange to like the sound so much as a non-Muslim, but the subject came up yesterday between other students and they enjoy it too. Music is in every part of the city several times a day— it’s beautiful.
          </p>

A sound I did not expect to hear is the roving music of ice cream trucks. Rather than peddling ice cream however, gas trucks rove the city playing tunes for citizens to restock their gas stoves or other appliances. I prefer running after ice cream!</p>
