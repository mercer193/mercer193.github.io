        <p>It’s been about thirty-six hours since I landed in Jordan and the time has passed more quickly and wonderfully than I could have imagined. I was most worried that I would be unable to to communicate with my host family, but they speak English quite well; the eight year old learned from YouTube videos!

The family speaks to me mostly in English now, but we plan to transition to more and more Arabic once I begin school on Sunday. They are so eager to teach me and we have already spent hours of pointing at things and repeating their names. I think I’ll be able to learn a semester’s worth of material in one month at this rate! So far, so good.</p>
