    <h1>Claire's Study Abroad Blog</h1>

    <p>I created this website to share my experiences in Jordan with friends and family back home. Posts will be in English and Arabic, some times both. I am a student of both coding and Arabic, so please forgive my mistakes. Constructive criticism is always welcome! You can reach me at mercer.193@osu.edu.</p>
